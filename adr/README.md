# Architecture Decision Records

See https://github.blog/2020-08-13-why-write-adrs/

A brief list of things to record here include:

Why I've chosen...

* To keep Ansible Roles locally instead of in their own separate repo
* To use folders to version playbooks instead of relying on Git
* To follow trunk/main based development for this repository instead of branches
