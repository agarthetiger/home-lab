# ADR for ADRs

A record of why I chose to do something in a specific way is incredibly valuable for personal projects in particular, because I will often have long breaks between periods of working on something. It increases my enjoyment significantly if I've left myself valuable notes and diagrams about what I chose at the time and why. Alternatives I looked at and why I ruled them out at the time are also valuable.

I don't intend this to become an enterprise-grade record of ADRs. Personal projects have different purposes and goals so what is right here is most often not what I'd do professionally. Each approach is hopefully correct in the intended context.
